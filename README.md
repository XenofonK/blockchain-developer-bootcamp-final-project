# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
Final Project for Xenofon Kontouris for Consensys Blockchain Academy - Deployment of claims tokens for a shared pool of resources

The problem that this code is trying to solve is the fair and public destribution of claims tokens to an ever changing pool of assets. The problem is simple; assume an initial fund of X which is deployed across the Decentralized Finance space and has yielded returns. All initial participants have a clear and fair claim to these assets. However this becomes more complex when additional capital is added by new participants on an asynchronous basis. 

Mechanism for Final Project?
Stake $PASOK to Yield $ATH **
Redeem $PASOK to buy and burn $ATH (1% per redemption)
